Experiment Description	Dynamic acclimation of photosynthesis plays an important role in increasing plant fitness under variable light environments. Acclimation is mediated by a glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator, GPT2. This study examined whether plants lacking GPT2, which are defective in acclimation to increases in light, are more susceptible to oxidative stress. To understand this, we used the model plant of Arabidopsis thaliana (accession Wassilewskija-4 (Ws-4)) and compared this to mutants lacking GPT2. Plants were grown at low light (100 μmol m−2 s−1) for 7 weeks. For acclimation experiments, a set of plant from low light was transferred to 400 μmol m−2 s−1 for 7 days. Microarray analysis showed that gpt2 plants showed a greater induction of stress related genes relative to WT.

Protocol Description	P-AFFY-6 Affymetrix CEL analysis	P-AFFY-3 GeneChip hybridization	Microarrays were processed by RMA Bioconductor	Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana accession Wassilewskija-4 (Ws-4) and T-DNA insertion mutant gpt2 (FLAG_326E03; INRA, Versailles, France) were grown on an 8-hour day at an irradiance of 100 µmol.m-2.s-1 (Low Light or LL) at a temperature of 20°C day, 16°C night in 3\\" pots in peat-based multipurpose compost. Growth light was provided by warm white LEDs (colour temperature 3000-3200 K) Plants were grown for 8 weeks prior to experiments commencing. The youngest fully expanded leaves were identified prior to experimental treatments. For acclimation experiments, randomly selected plants were transferred to a shelf in the same growth cabinet set to a light intensity of 400 µmol.m-2.s-1 (High Light or HL). Plants were maintained at this irradiance for 1 or 7 days. Samples were taken after 4 hours illumination on the day of treatment. For each condition, a single mature leaf was detached from each of three plants and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
