Investigation Title	Primary Human Airway Epithelial Cultures infected with SARS-CoV-2																		
Experiment Description	We performed RNAseq analysis on primary human airway epithelial cultures either mock infected (PBS) or infected with SARS-CoV-2. Transcriptional profiling studies found that infected pHAE cells had a molecular signature dominated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine induction, including IL-6, TNFα, CXCL8, and identified NF-κB and ATF4 as key drivers of this pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a lack of a type I or III interferon (IFN) response to SARS-CoV-2 infection pHAE cultures were infected apically with SARS-CoV-2 (MOI= 0.25) for 48 hours, at which point mock and SARS-CoV-2 infected (n=3) samples were harvested for bulk RNA-Seq analysis.

Protocol Description	pHAE cultures were infected at MOI= 0.5 for 48 hours. RNA was harvested from mock and infected pHAE cultures (n=3) by gently scraping the Transwell insert with a plunger to dislodge the cells, which were then lysed by treatment with RNA lysis buffer for > 5 minutes.	Total RNA was extracted using the Zymo Quick-RNA MiniPrep kit (VWR, R1055) according to the manufacturers protocol. Libraries were generated using the Clontech SMART-Seq v4 kit, barcoding and sequencing primers were added using NexteraXT Library Prep kit. Libraries were validated by microelectrophoresis, quantified, pooled and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 in 100-base single-read reactions.	Illumina bcl2fastq v2.17.1.14 was used for demultiplexing. Reads were mapped to the human (GRCh38 Ensemble release 100) and SARS-CoV2 (MT246667.1) genomic reference with STAR (v2.7.3a) with default alignment parameters. Abundance estimation of raw read counts per transcript was done internally with STAR using the algorithm of htseq-count. A value of '1' was added to each of the normalized read counts. This provides a value to genes which show no read counts and allows for appropriate calculations of fold change. Low abundance transripts are moe influenced by highly expressed transcripts. Genome_build: GRCh38 Ensembl release 100 (primary assembly) and MT246667.1 reference. ORF7b was annotated in MT246667.1 based on NC_045512.2 reference Supplementary_files_format_and_content: STARv2.7.3a was used to generate the raw read counts. Read counts were normalized using DESeq2 through R software.
